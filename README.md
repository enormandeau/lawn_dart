# Lawn Dart
Model Rocketry Flight Simulator

# About
**Lawn Dart** is a crude but evolving rocket flight simulator. It is written in
ANSI C. It also happens to be my first C project. Its aims is primarily to be a
fun project to canalyze my C programming apprentisship. I am, however, keen on
getting feedback and ideas about how to turn this baby project into a useful
program.

This is developped with Linux and MacOSX users in mind, althought it should
work fine under Windows. I do not use Windows, however, so I cannot confirm it.
If anybody would like to report on Windows usage or specificities about
installation, I will be glad to add the information in this manual.

# Installing
To use **Lawn Dart**, you will need to compile it. From the `src` folder,
simply run `make` to compile the program. The `lawn_dart` executable will be
created. `sudo make install` will attempt to install it to `/usr/local/bin`.

# Usage
Launch the executable without options (either `./lawn_dart` or simply
`lawn_dart` if you installed it system wide) to see the usage help
